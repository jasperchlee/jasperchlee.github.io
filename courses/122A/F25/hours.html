<h3>Collaboration Hours (all Discussion sections will also be run as collab hours)</h3>
<p>Time: Mondays, 10:00am-10:50am<br>
	Location: Wellman 212<br>
	Host: Jasper
</p>
	
<p>Time: Tuesdays, 9:00am-9:50am<br>
	Location: Olson 205<br>
	Host: Suraj
</p>

<p>Time: Thursdays, 9:00am-9:50am<br>
	Location: Hoagland 113<br>
	Host: Suraj
</p>

<p>We are working with the registrar to book rooms to add more collaboration hours. In particular, in our current plan (waiting for confirmation from the registrar), Jasper will offer 2 more hours per week (as one longer 2-hour session), the undergraduate tutors will offer 2 sessions of 2 hours per week by hosting in pairs, and Suraj will also host another 2 hour session during the week.</p>

<p>
Collaboration hours are an opportunity for you to work with other
students (in addition to your homework partners) on problems, with the
course staff providing appropriate nudges and hints to help you
productively make progress on the assignments.
</p>

<p><b>If you get stuck on homework problems, come to collab hours instead of LLMs/the internet to get help!</b></p>
