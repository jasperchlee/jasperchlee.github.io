<h3>Mental Health</h3>

Being a student can be stressful.
If you feel you are under too much pressure or there are psychological
issues that are keeping you from performing well at UCD, we
encourage you to contact UCD's <a target="_blank" href="https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/">Student Health and Counseling Services</a>.
They provide confidential counselling.

<h3>Coping with Unforeseen or Difficult Circumstances</h3>

If there are unforeseen or difficult circumstances affecting your ability to do well in the course, we are happy to take them into account with respect to our late policy.
Please feel free to talk to the instructor about this.
Additionally, the <a target="_blank" href="https://ossja.ucdavis.edu/">Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs</a> can be a helpful resource for discussing current concerns and academic and personal plans.
