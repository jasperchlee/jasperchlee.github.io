Collaboration hours are an opportunity for you to work with other
students (in addition to your homework partners) on problems, with the
course staff providing appropriate nudges and hints to help you
productively make progress on the assignments.
</p>

<p><b>If you get stuck on homework problems, come to collab hours instead of LLMs/the internet to get help!</b></p>
