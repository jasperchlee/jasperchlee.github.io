<h3>Teaching at Brown</h3>
In Fall 2020, I created and lectured <a target="_top" href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1951-w/">CS1951W &ndash; Sublinear Algorithms for Big Data</a>, an advanced undergraduate course with a graduate level supplement.
</p>
<p>
In Fall 2016-2018, I was the graduate TA for <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs157/" target="_top">CS157 &ndash; Design and Analysis of Algorithms</a>,
when the course was lectured by my then-advisor <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~pvaliant/"
target="_top">Paul Valiant</a>.
</p>
<h3>Teaching at Cambridge</h3>
<p>
At Cambridge, I have taught for <a href="http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk" target="_top">Churchill</a> and affiliated colleges.
I supervised (&asymp; TA) the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/current/AdvAlgo/" target="_top">Advanced
Algorithms</a> course, and hosted examples classes for various theory (logic and semantics related) courses.
</p>
<h3>Churchill Computer Science Talks Series</h3>
<p>
I co-organised (2014-2017) with <a href="http://mti.me.uk"
target="_blank">Matthew Ireland</a> the <a href="http://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/15345" target="_top">Churchill
Computer Science Talks Series</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyBk6W5OKWUQRiQhP1Zhzg" target="_top">Selected talks</a>) from a distance, or "across the pond" as
the British would say.
Talks are delivered by second and third year undergraduate students at
Churchill and affiliated colleges, on topics beyond the scope of the
university course.
As a co-organiser, I advised students in their talk preparations.
