<h2><p style="padding-bottom:0px;margin-bottom:10px;">ECS 189A: Sublinear Algorithms for Big Data</p>
	Fall 2024</h2>

<h4>Staff</h4>

<p>Instructor: <a href="http://jasperchlee.github.io">Jasper Lee</a></p>

<h4>Time/Location</h4>

<p>Time: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 4:40pm-6:00pm<br>
	Location: Teaching and Learning Complex 3214</p>

<h4>Course Description</h4>

<p>A huge quantity of data is worth little unless we can extract insights from it. Yet, the large quantities mean that classic algorithms (running in linear, quadratic or even more time) can be infeasible in practice.
We must instead turn to new algorithmic approaches and paradigms, which allow us to answer valuable questions about our data in runtime that is still feasible even when the data set is Facebook-sized.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, to answer many computational and statistical questions, sometimes there is no need to read/store every piece of data!
This course focuses on this exciting "sublinear" algorithmic regime.

<p>See the course <a target="_blank" href="resources/missive.pdf">missive</a> for details on assessment and various
policies.</p>

<p><b>**Counts as a "field of specialization" course for GGAM programmes (MS and PhD)</b></p>
  
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<p>This is an advanced undergraduate level course that is also suitable for graduate students.</p>

<p>Suggested prior courses (see course missive above for details, and see Homework 0):
<ul>
	<li> ECS 20 or equivalent, for basic discrete math, and</li>
	<li> ECS 132 or MAT 135A or STA 130A or equivalent, for basic probability (and linear algebra), and</li>
	<li> ECS 122A or ECS 222A or equivalent, for basic algorithm analysis</li>
</ul>
Email the instructor if you have questions about whether you are prepared for the course.
</p>

<p>Mathematical maturity is essential: we will prove most of the
results covered in the class. Almost all homework problems will require proof-writing.</p>
